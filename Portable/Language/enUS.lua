	All English language clients return "enUS" now, so we don't need to check
	for "enGB" (English - Great Brittan / United Kingdom) anymore.
	
	The AddOn is written in this language so we don't need this line;
		if (GetLocale() ~= "enUS") then return end

--[[
	Even though the AddOn is written in this language, some text overrides
	can be used as a sort of shorthand which can be useful for long text or
	commonly used text.
		Example;
			L["longText"] = "This is a long string of characters."
		
		In the AddOn, now we can simply use L["longText"] and it will be
		replaced with; This is a long string of characters.
