Portable is a fairly customizable UI for Mage Teleport and Portal spells. Combining Teleport and Portal spells into a smart single-click system based on your Group status. Customize the order you want the destinations to appear using an easy Drag-and-Drop list or let Portable learn where you go most and order things for you. The Portable UI now comes with Hearthstone support (The Garrison Hearthstone, regular Hearthstone, and The Innkeeper's Daughter are supported). Choose from several different Layout, Frame, and Button styles. Put the text where you want it, set the color, and use the Font you like. Use a Key-Binding to Toggle the UI or a Slash Command (which can be used in a macro).
